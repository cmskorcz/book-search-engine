## Deployed Site
[book-search-engine](https://afternoon-headland-37737.herokuapp.com/)
## Description
MERN application allowing a user to create an account and search for books. A user can then save books that they are intereted in to their account. The application originally used RESTful API, and the purpose of the project was to transition to graphQL. Additional starter code was also provided by class instructor. At this time, a user is unable to save books to their account due to an authorization error. When a user is logged in, an error still occurs on "Save Book" button click stating in the console that a user must be logged in. I believe that this error is due to issues with the router on page changes, and will be further looking into the issue when time allows.
